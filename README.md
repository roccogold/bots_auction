# bots_auction
Execution of a BPMN workflow for the placement of government securities (Treasury Bills - BOTs) through an automated and competitive auction stored in blockchain.

The project is a simplified demo representing a smart contract that runs on top of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0). 
The goal of this solution is to automate the allocation of Treasury Bills - BOTs emitted by Bank of Italy through a competitive and public auction. This choreograpahic representation improves how contracts are created and modified in a more legible way by enabling organizations to pilot the processes through APIs and digital signatures (TLS).
