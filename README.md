# bots_auction
Execution of a BPMN workflow for the placement of government securities (Treasury Bills - BOTs) through an automated and competitive auction stored in blockchain.

The project represents a smart contract on Shared Technologies' blockchain through the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0) Standard. 
This choreograpahic representation improves how contracts are created and modified in a more legible way by enabling organizations to pilot the process through APIs and/or digital signatures (TLS). The goal of this solution is to automate the allocation of Treasury Bills - BOTs emitted by Bank of Italy through a competitive and public auction.
